        <h1>ABOUT EMI</h1>
        <p>EMI or Equated Monthly Installment is the fixed amount paid by a borrower on a monthly basis to the lender. It is generally paid by the customer on a particular calendar date until the principal amount and the total interest accrued on it for the loan duration are paid off. The EMI amount is calculated in such a way that the interest of the loan is larger during the initial months and reduces gradually with each payment. Key parameters used in EMI calculation for a personal loan are:</p>
    <h4>Principle Amount:</h4>
    <p class="p">The base amount that is lent to the customer as loan is called the principal amount. It may differ from lender to lender based on their evaluation of the customer’s credit profile. The principal amount for a personal loan is typically upto ₹100000.</p>
    <h4>Intrest Rate:</h4>
    <p class="p">The rate of interest is the percentage which can be levied on the principal amount of a loan on a periodic basis as a proportion of the amount lent which can be upto 30% for personal loans.</p>
    <h4>Loan Duration:</h4>
    <p class="p">The loan duration or loan term, also commonly referred to as “tenor” is the period for which a loan is sanctioned. The borrower must pay the principal sum and the total interest within the loan duration. The tenor for personal loan can be anywhere between few months or few years (up to 10 years).</p>
